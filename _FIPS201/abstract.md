# ABSTRACT {#abstract}

Authentication of an individual's identity is a fundamental component of physical and
logical access control. An access control decision must be made
when an individual attempts to access security-sensitive 
buildings, information systems, and applications. An 
accurate determination of an individual's identity supports making sound access control
decisions.
