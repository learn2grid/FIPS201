# Draft FIPS 201-3: Personal Identity Verification (PIV) of Federal Employees and Contractors
The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) requests comments on Draft Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) 201-3, Personal Identity Verification (PIV) of Federal Employees and Contractors (Standard). This Standard defines common credentials and authentication mechanisms offering varying degrees of security for both logical and physical access applications. The draft revision proposes changes to FIPS 201-2, Standard for Personal Identity Verification of Federal Employees and Contractors to include: expanding specification on the use of additional PIV credentials known as derived PIV credentials, procedures for supervised remote identity proofing, the use of federation as a means for a relying system to interoperate with PIV credentials issued by other agencies, alignment with the current practice/policy of the Federal Government and specific changes requested by Federal agencies and implementers.
